# Portfolio Website

This website is created to highlight my personal projects and contact information. The website allows users to change the theme color of the website using 
JavaScript and CSS. The website also allows users to navigate to different pages on the website and enter their contact information into the form I created using HTML

The different theme colors are white, blue, green, and purple.
