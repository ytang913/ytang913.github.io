                        <h4>About</h4>

                        <p>This project is a Tic Tac Toe board that users can play on Eclispe IDE</p>

                        <p>This project allows 2 players to play</p>

                        <p>The game will randomly assign 'X' or 'O' to have the first turn</p>

                        <p>The first player to get three in a row wins the game</p>

                        <p>If no player gets three in a row, then the game will have to be restarted</p>

                        <h4>Documentation</h4>

                        <p>This project is done using Java</p>

                        <p>There are two public classes created: TicTacToe and Main</p>

                        <p>In the TicTacToe public class a Java ActionListener interface was implemented</p>

                        <p>
                            Within this interface, a Random class, JFrame class, JPanel class for the title and button,
                            JLabel class, JButton array, and a boolean. 
                        </p>
                        <p> Furthermore, a constructor TicTacToe() and five methods are found within the 
                            TicTacToe public class. The five methods are actionPerformed, firstTurn, check, XWins, OWins
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A constructor TicTacToe() is created and within that contains setting up the title panel,
                            buttons, and the frame. This is done by using setters, for loops, and arrays. Then the firstTurn
                            method was called.

                        </p>

                        <p>actionPerformed is a method where the user can interact with the Tic Tac Toe board and
                            within that method  contains for loops and if/else statements.
                        </p>

                        <p>firstTurn is a method that decides randomly whether or not 'O' or 'X'
                            goes first. Within this method contains a try/catch statement and 
                            if/else statements.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            check is a method that checks which user wins the game and is calling either XWins 
                            or OWins. Within this method contains if/else statements, arrays, and methods.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            XWins method checks that the X player wins and it takes in three paremeters of integers. 
                            Within this method contains arrays and for loops.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            OWins method checks that the O player wins and it takes in three parameters of integers.
                            Within this method contains arrays and for loops.
                        </p>

                        <p>In order to start the game the user must click on the play button in Eclispe</p>
