                        <p>The two projects I worked on for this class is Assignment 1 and the Final Media Project.</p>

                        
                        <h4>Documentation</h4>

                        <h5>Assignment 1</h5>
                        <p>The goal of this assignment is to perform calculations using Weight objects which are
                            instances of Weight class.</p>
                        <p>
                            This assignment consists of two classes: Weight.java and Project.java
                        </p>

                        <h6>Weight.java</h6>

                        <p>The Weight.java class has three private variables, two private methods 
                            and four public methods</p>

                        <h6>Private variables for Weight.java </h6>
                        <p> A private constant variable called OUNCES_IN_A_POUND that defines the number of ounces in a pound (16).</p>
                        
                        <p>A private variable called pounds with a data type of integer. </p>

                        <p>A private variable called pounds with a data type of integer.</p>

                        <p>A private variable called ounces with a data type of double.</p>

                        <h6>Methods for Weight.java</h6>

                        <p> A public parameterized constructor, which initializes the private variables:  
                            public Weight (int pounds, double ounces).</p>

                        <p>A private instance method called toOunces with a return type of double. This method
                            has no parameters and should return the total number of ounces.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A private instance method called normalize with a return type of void. This method has no 
                            parameters and ensures the he number of ounces is less than the number of ounces in a pound.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A public instance method called lessThan with a return type of boolean. 
                            This method will accept a Weight object as a parameter and determine if the object is 
                            greater or less than the initialized values
                            :public boolean lessThan (Weight weight) 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A public instance method called addTo with a return type of void.
                            This method will accept a Weight object as a parameter and add the 
                            object’s weight values to the initialized values: public void addTo (Weight weight)
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            A public instance method called toString with a return type of String. 
                            This method has no parameters and should have the following format: x pounds and y ounces 
                            where x is the number of pounds and y 
                            the number of ounces. Ounces will be displayed with two decimal places.
                        </p>

                        <h6>Project1.java</h6>

                        <p>Project1 Class has three private methods and one public method.</p>

                        <h6>Methods for Project1.java</h6>

                        <p>A private class method named findMinimum with a return type of Weight. 
                            This method will accept three Weight objects as parameters and compare each Weight object’s 
                            weight values to find the minimum. The Weight object with the minimum weight value 
                            will be returned and then printed using toString in the following format: 
                            The minimum weight is x pounds and y ounces where x is the number of pounds 
                            and y the number of ounces. Ounces will be displayed with two decimal places.</p>

                        <p>A private class method named findMaximum with a return type of Weight. 
                            This method will accept three Weight objects as parameters and compare each Weight object’s 
                            weight values to find the maximum. 
                            The Weight object with the maximum weight value will be returned and 
                            then printed using toString in the following format: 
                            The maximum weight is x pounds and y ounces where x 
                            is the number of pounds and y the number of ounces. Ounces will be displayed with two decimal places.
                        </p>

                        <p>A private class method named findAverage with a return type of Weight. 
                            This method will accept three Weight objects as parameters and calculate the average weight value. 
                            A new Weight object with the average weight values will be returned and 
                            then printed using toString in the following format: The average weight is x pounds and y ounces 
                            where x is the number of pounds and y the number of ounces. Ounces will be displayed 
                            with two decimal places.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A public method named main with a return type of void. 
                            This method should exercise the correct functionality of findMinimum, 
                            findMaximum and findAverage by creating three Weight objects using the
                             hardcoded values below: 
                             Weight weight1 = new Weight(11, 3); 
                             Weight weight2 = new Weight(7, 20);</p>
                        </p>

                        <h5>Media Project </h5>

                        

                        Media hierarchy:
 Create Media, EBook, MovieDVD, and MusicCD classes from Week 3 -> Practice
Exercise - Inheritance solution.
 Add an attribute to Media class to store indication when media object is rented versus
available. Add code to constructor and create get and set methods as appropriate.
 Add any additional constructors and methods needed to support the below
functionality
2) Design and implement Manager class which (Hint: check out Week 8 Reading and Writing
files example):
 stores a list of Media objects
 has functionality to load Media objects from files
 creates/updates Media files
 has functionality to add new Media object to its Media list
 has functionality to find all media objects for a specific title and returns that list
 has functionality to rent Media based on id (updates rental status on media, updates
file, returns rental fee)
3) Design and implement MediaRentalSystem which has the following functionality:
 user interface which is either menu driven through console commands or GUI buttons
or menus. Look at the bottom of this project file for sample look and feel. (Hint: for
command-driven menu check out Week 2: Practice Exercise - EncapsulationPlus and
for GUI check out Week 8: Files in GUI example)
 selection to load Media files from a given directory (user supplies directory)
 selection to find a media object for a specific title value (user supplies title and should
display to user the media information once it finds it - should find all media with that
title)
 selection to rent a media object based on its id value (user supplies id and should
display rental fee value to the user)
 selection to exit program
4) Program should throw and catch Java built-in and user-defined exceptions as appropriate
5) Your classes must be coded with correct encapsulation: private/protected attributes, get
methods, and set methods and value validation
6) There should be appropriate polymorphism: overloading, overriding methods, and dynamic
binding
7) Program should take advantage of the inheritance properties as appropriate
