                        <h4>About</h4>

                        <p>This project is a Login Registration Application
                             built using React.JS, Express, MongoDB, Bootstrap CSS, and axios</p>

                        <p>Users are tasked to enter in four fields: 
                            Full Name, Username, Email, and Password
                        </p>                  
                        
                        <p>To run the application the user must first go the terminal and type in 
                            cd loginfront
                        </p>

                        <p>Then the user should enter in npm start to start up the React application</p>

                        <p>The user should then restart the terminal and type in 
                            cd loginbackend
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Then type in npm start to run the server and connect to the Mongoose Library
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When successfully connected the terminal should say "Database is connected"
                        </p>
                    
                        <h4>Documentation</h4>

                        <h5>Backend</h5>

                        <p>Express and MongoDB was used for this portion.</p>

                        <p>server.js is created for the backend server and also connected to Mongoose</p>

                        <p>When a user enters in their information a POST request is sent to the backend
                            and router.post will handle it. The Post request will also create a new 
                            schema
                        </p>

                        <p>LoginModels.js is created for the schema and Mongoose is housed here
                            and within it there are five fields Full Name, Username, Email, password, 
                            and Date.</p>
                        <p>
                            The Four fields: Full Name, Username, Email, and password is what the user will 
                            enter in, while the Date field will allow me to know which month,day, and year they 
                            entered in their information.  
                        </p>

                        <p>MongoDB Cloud Atlas is used to house the data received from Post requests
                            and it allows me to see the requests. </p>
                        
                        <p>A cluster was created within MongoDB Cloud Atlas and it is powered by AWS.</p>

                        <h5>Frontend</h5>
                        <p>
                            React.JS was used for this portion.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>A super class and constructor is created for the different 
                            states for the Login Registration Application.
                            The states are Full Name, Username, Email, and password
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When the user puts their information in the empty form and clicks on
                            submit, the onSubmit event will be triggered and it will 
                            gather the values that the user entered.</p>
                            
                        <p>The information is stored in the states
                            and then it will be saved in the arraylist registered
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Then the information from registered will be sent to the backend server
                            which is done using axios.</p>
                        <p> 
                            Axios essentially connects the frontend and backend so that the information
                            from the frontend can be passsed to the backend. 
                        </p>
