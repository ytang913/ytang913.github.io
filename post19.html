                        <h4>About</h4>

                        <p>This project is a Login Registration Application
                             built using React.JS, Express, MongoDB,Bootstrap CSS, and axios</p>

                        <p>Users are tasked to enter in four fields: 
                            Full Name, Username, Email, and Password
                        </p>                       
                    
                        <h4>Documentation</h4>

                        <h5>Backend</h5>

                        <p>Express and MongoDB was used for this portion.</p>

                        <p>server.js is created for the backend server and also connected to Mongoose</p>

                        <p>routes.js is created to route the requests that come to the server</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>LoginModels.js is created for the schema and Mongoose is housed here
                            and within it there are five fields Full Name, Username, Email, password, 
                            and Date.</p>
                        <p>
                            The Four fields: Full Name, Username, Email, and password is what the user will 
                            enter in, while the Date field will allow me to know which month,day, and year they 
                            entered in their information.  
                        </p>

                        <p>MongoDB Cloud Atlas is used to house the data received from Post requests
                            and it allows me to see the requests.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Frontend</h5>

                        <p>
                            React.JS was used for this portion.
                        </p>

                        <p>When a user enters in their information a POST request is sent
                            and router.post will handle it
                        </p>

                        <p>The Post request will also create a new schema</p>

                        <p>Created a cluster on mongo atlas powered by AWS</p>

                        <p>super class and constructor to hold on the states for the login registration</p>

                        <p>we are using the setState function to change the events </p>

                        <p>When the user puts their information in the empty form, the onSubmit event will be triggered 
                            then the methods will be triggered. When the user clicks on submit, the 
                            onSubmit event will be triggered and it will gather the values that the 
                            user entered which are stored in the states. They will save it in registered.

                            We are then gonna send registered into the backend. which is done using axios

                        </p>

                        <p>Whatever the user is typing will be saved in states</p>
