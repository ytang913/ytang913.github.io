                        <h4>UMD Departments Relational Database</h4>
                        <p>
                            For this project, my goal is to build a relational database that 
                            showcases the different functions and structures of each 
                            individual department at UMD. The relational database will also highlight 
                            the relationships among the different departments as 
                            well as their individual characteristics. </p>
                        <p>
                            This project is comprised of an ERD model and eleven SQL queries.
                            The created ERD Model showcases the different relationships 
                            between the eight entities that represent UMD’s infrastructure. 
                            I then forward engineered my ERD Model and stored the sample data from 
                            a csv file I created containing information about the different 
                            UMD different departments into each of the eight different 
                            entities from my ERD Model. </p>
                        
                        <p>The eleven created SQL queries were based on hypothetical questions designed
                            to highlight the relationships between each entity. Each SQL query was created 
                            as a view so that when a user downloads the backup file they are able to see 
                            the queries as well.</p>
