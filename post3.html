                        <h4>About</h4>
                        <p>
                            For this project, my goal is to build a relational database that 
                            showcases the different functions and structures of each 
                            individual department at UMD. </p>
                            
                          <p>The relational database will also highlight 
                            the relationships among the different departments as 
                            well as their individual characteristics. </p>
                        <h4>Documentation</h4>
                        <p>This project is comprised of an ERD model and eleven SQL queries.</p>
                        <p> The created ERD Model showcases the different relationships 
                            between the eight entities that represent UMDâ€™s infrastructure.</p>
                        <p> 
                            I then forward engineered my ERD Model and stored the sample data from 
                            a csv file I created containing information about the different 
                            UMD different departments into each of the eight different 
                            entities from my ERD Model. </p>
                        
                        <p>The eleven created SQL queries were based on hypothetical questions designed
                            to highlight the relationships between each entity. </p>

                        <p>Each SQL query was created as a view so that when a user downloads the backup file they are able to see 
                            the queries as well.</p>
