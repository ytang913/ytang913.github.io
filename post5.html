                        <h4>About </h4>
                        <p> PGC Crime Collector is a web-based application that is
                            designed to solve the lack in accessible information the
                            Prince George's County general public has on their communities. 
                            With the website, users are able to navigate accurate and organized 
                            PG County crimes via the search and data functionality.
                        </p>

                        <p>This web-based application is split up in two sections Home, About, and Data</p>

                        <h5>Home Page</h5>
                        <p>
                            Users can search for specific crime entries and see information 
                            about each crime including the Case ID, Date, Crime Type, and Street Address. 
                            They can filter through the data by using the drop down filter list 
                            to select the specific crime type they wish to see in the results. 
                            The crime type includes Accident, Theft, Robbery, Sex Offence, and Assault.
                        </p>

                        <h5>About Page</h5>

                        <p>
                            This page is to allow users to know what is the purpose of this web application.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Data Page</h5>
                        <p>
                            Users can explore data on the Crime Incidents February 2017 to Present dataset 
                            to see a more personal representation of Prince George's County crime from 
                            residents and incoming residents. 
                            They can engage with the data visual by hovering and inputing a crime type.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If users are unable to find the crime incident they are looking for they 
                            can add it to our website and then when refreshing the crime incident will appear.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Documenation</h4>

                        <p>This web-based application was created using 
                            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, JSON file, Leaflet, 
                            SQLite, Express, and Node.Js.</p>
    
                        <p>
                            I used HTML and CSS for the overall design of the frontend portion 
                            of the web application. 
                            JavaScript for the user interactions with the web application.
                        </p>

                        <p>Leaflet was used for the map creation based on the Open Street Map API.</p>

                        <p>
                            Express/Node.Js and SQLite was used for the backend part of the website, 
                            essentially storing the data from the PG County API.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            SQLite was used to filter out five different types of crimes of accidents,
                            theft, sex offense, robbery, and assualt for the Home page
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            SQLite was also used to allow users to add crimes they did not
                            see in our website and have our database create a table based on that 
                            adding if found in the PG County API
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            PUT requests can be submitted to the API and is used 
                            to send data to our server to update our database 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            GET requests can be retrieved from the API and it retrieves 
                            a list of JSON objects containing Prince Georges County crimes information 
                            from the database
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            GET requests can also 
                            return a confirmation string or an error message once completed
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            POST is used to add data to the database, which is in the Data Page
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The data of the different crimes came from the  
                            <a href = "">PG County API</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>The web based application was deployed on:
                              <a href ="#">Heroku</a>
