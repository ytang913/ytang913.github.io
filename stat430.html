                        <h4>About</h4>
                        <p>The two projects I worked on for this class are centered around using SAS and conducting studies.</p>

                        <h5>Project 1</h5>
                        <p>The purpose of this project is to conduct a study to see if there is a relation 
                            between the number of hours students sleep and the students' GPA. </p>

                        <h6>Quantative variables </h6>

                        <p>Average hours of sleep per week</p>
                         <p> GPA</p>

                         <h6>Categorical variables</h6>
                         <p>Students' Major</p>
                         <p> Students' class standing (Freshman, Softmore, Junior, and Senior)</p>

                         <h6>Findings</h6>
                         <p>Based on the SAS code I found that the average GPA among college students is 3.49
                            and the average amount of sleep for college students is 42.8 hours. The boxplot and probability
                            plot showcases that the distribution for this is not normal. This is probably due to my style of
                            questioning where I am comparing the average hours of sleep a student gets and their GPA. If I
                            changed the wording the results of my box plot and probability plot would be different. However,
                            based on the Quartiles the quartile measure would be the median. In this case, the median is 42
                            based on the 30 participants in the survey. Furthermore, based on the 30 participants there are
                            2 architecture majors, 1 biochemistry major, 1 biology major, 1 chemistry major, 1
                            communication major, 2 computer science majors, 2 Economics major, 7 engineer majors, 2
                            english majors, 1 GIS major, 1 Information Science major, 1 Information Systems major, 1
                            Marketing Major, 2 Math majors, 1 Music Major, 1 Physics Major, 1 Political Science Major, 1
                            Public Health Major, and 1 Supply Chain Major. For class standings, among the 30 participants
                            there are 6 Freshman, 6 Sophomore, 8 Juniors, and 10 Seniors.</p>

                        <h5>Project 2 </h5>

                        <p>The purpose of this project is to utilize different SAS functions to answer a set of questions relating to the relationship between
                            college students' GPA and the average hours of sleep they get per week.</p>

                        <h5>Questions </h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Anova results from the PROC REG and what it means (p-value and significance)</li>
                            <li>The r-squared value and what it means.</li>
                            <li>Regression results and what it means (p-values on variables,
                        significance, residuals). You must give the following: </li>
                            <li>The regression equation.</li>
                            <li>The p-value for the intercept and slope variable(s).</li>

                            <li>The residual analysis, look at the normal probability plot and
                        analyze and the residuals by regression for dependent variable.</li>
                            <li>Make sure all assumption is met. Explain what this does to your
                        results</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h5>Answers</h5>

                        <ol>
                                <li>Based on my sample, the p-value from the ANOVA table <
                            (0.0001) is very small which indicates that the model is good
                            to predict the college student’s GPA based on the average
                            hours of sleep they get per week if all of the conditions are
                            met. </li>
                                <li>The R-square value indicates that 80.1 % of the variation in the
                            College student’s GPA is due to the average hours of sleep
                            they get each week.</li>
                                <li>Regression results and what it means (p-values on variables,
                            significance, residuals). You must give the following: </li>
                                <li>GPA = -17.51 + 17.24 * SLEEP</li>
                                <li>P-value intercept = 0.0048,  P-value slope = < 0.0001
                                </li>
                                <li>The intercept is very small which indicates that the
                            intercept is significant. This means that the p-value for
                            the intercept is important and should be analyzed. The p-value for the slope is < 0.0001 which indicates
                            that the value of the slope is not 0. Therefore, using
                            17.24 as the value of the slope is reasonable, as long as
                            all conditions are met.</li>
                                <li>The normal probability plot showcases that there is a
                            linear relationship present but there are some outliers
                            presents. The boxplot indicates that there are outliers present
                            just based on the shape of the boxplot. </li>
                                <li>Based on the probability plot, it seems that the data is
                            linear related however, the scatter plot does not
                            indicate this. Furthermore, the box plot showcases
                            that there are outliers present in the data. Based on
                            the regression analysis it is also reasonable to assume
                            the residuals are not identically distributed.</li>
                        </ol>
