                        <h6>How does our application create joy?</h6>

                        <p>Covid-19 has led to the closing of many entertainment locations including theaters, 
                            escape rooms, mini-golfing, and more. In some places, these entertainment locations open up 
                            with COVID-19 precautions and guidelines only to close back down several weeks later. Due to this, 
                            it becomes difficult to keep track of which places are open and which aren’t. Furthermore, the lack 
                            of revenue for these entertainment places means that they may have shut down temporarily or permanently. 
                            With people having to stay at home and keeping their distance from others, the toll on everyone’s mental
                             health is increasing. Entertainment is one way to bring joy to one’s life and the pandemic has either
                              prevented this from happening or has greatly impeded it. Therefore, our application can bring joy to our
                               users because it lets users know which entertainment locations are open during the Pandemic. 
                               It also makes searching for business information less stressful, and a lot more effective. 
                               Our research with users showed us that keeping up with business information can be stressful, and
                                our application is aimed to reduce this stress.

                        </p>

                        <h6>Our Application has more value than Google</h6>

                        <p>
                            This application has more value than Google Maps because all the information will be housed 
                            in one place. In Google there are a lot of missing information and it forces the user to call 
                            specific businesses to get more information. Our application stops that because we are able have all
                            the data housed in one source. This allows the users to get all the information they need without 
                            having to forage for all of their information. Furthermore, our push notification setting allows users
                             to get directly notified when the businesses they follow update their policies. 
                             This means that user-tailored COVID updates are sent directly to the users phone. 
                             Lastly, the forum section allows users to read other costumers comments on the business, 
                             which could be helpful if the business hasn’t posted the specific information needed.

                            The entertainment locations we are looking into are movies, concerts, sports, bars, arcades, mini-golf, etc. 
                            It is important to note that this is not an all exhaustive list and we will use collected data to help narrow or broaden or focus.

                        <p>
                            Given the pandemic that we are living in, many people still want to have some sort of normalcy. 
                            With the need for normalcy in mind, finding which entertainment locations are open to the public 
                            is a priority. Our research focused on
                             designing an application that would make finding entertainment a more seamless experience to 
                             bring joy to our users.

                        <h6>Methods and Lo-fi Prototype</h6>

                        <h7>Contextual Enquires </h7>

                        <p>The main method we used for gathering data for our prototype is contextual enquiries. 
                            Contextual Enquiries are interviews for designers to understand the context of users. 
                            Contextual Enquires are broken down into five categories of Activities, Environments, Interactions, 
                            Objects, and Users. Our team used contextual enquires with three users being interviewed per team member. 
                            Since the team consists of five members in total we had fifteen contextual enquiries. 
                            In those fifteen contextual enquiries, we were able to understand what the users’ context is in terms 
                            of who they are as a user, their environment preferences, the interactions they do on a daily basis, 
                            the objects they use in their environment, and finally their daily activities.

                        </p>

                        <h7>Empathy Maps  </h7>

                        <p>
                            After we gathered the contextual enquires, to understand and differentiate the
                             fifteen contextual enquires, we used the Empathy Map. The Empathy Map comprises 
                             of four categories: Says, Does, Thinks, and Feels. These four categories were used 
                             to differentiate each contextual enquiry making it more easier for us to understand the user itself. 
                        </p>

                        <h7>Lo-fi Prototype </h7>

                        <p>
                            We then incorporated ideas from the Empathy Map and implemented into the Low Fidelity Prototype also known as Lo-Fi Prototype. 
                            This prototype is essentially a draft of what our application would like. In terms of creation we used Figma. 
                            In Figma we used components from the Lo-Fi Wireframe and images from google to make up the overall design of the Lo-Fi Prototype. 
                            We also designed different screens users will see when interacting with our application.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In our Lo-Fi Prototype, we have six screens that user will be looking at: Home, Browse,
                             Search, Business, Notifications, and Profile.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Home screen is where the users can see all the businesses they followed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Search screen is where users can search up any specific Business they are interested in.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Business screen showcases a specific Business where their Covid-19 Opening policies, 
                            information about their business, and comments from the customers about their business.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Browse screen is where the users can search up different businesses they are interested in 
                            learning about in terms of COVID-19 Policies and other users’ experience. 
                            This screen has three sections within it: Categories, Locations, and Most Popular.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Notifications screen allows users to see the different notifications from the businesses 
                            that the user follows.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Profile screen allows user to see the businesses they follow, set their location, 
                            and the settings.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In order to get feedback we met with another design team in our studio. 
                            We did this by sharing the video with them and answering questions and taking 
                            into consideration some of their thoughts and critiques. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The other design team’s suggestions were to add a login screen, create a quick tutorial for new users, 
                            elaborate on a rating system, add a language functionality for users that prefer to speak other 
                            languages besides English, and finally add more filters in the search screen.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Based on the feedback given, we decided to create a Login screen, Tutorial Screen, implement more 
                            filters in the search screen, and incorporate Google Business ratings in our application.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Login screen is for users to be able sign into our application with their username and password.
                             If the user is new then they can tap the Sign up button and go to the Tutorial we created for them.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Tutorial screen where new users can learn what each feature our application 
                            is composed of.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The filters we added in our Search screen are the radius of miles closest to the users’ 
                            location and the opening capacity of the Businesses.
                        </p>

                        <h7>Limitations in testing due to the Pandemic</h7>
                        <p>Due to the Pandemic there were many limitations in user testing but through online ingenuity we
                            were able to overcome these limitations. For User Testing we did through virtual means and in person. 
                            In Figma there is a functionality where you can link the screens so that when you click on a button, 
                            the user would be redirected to another screen. For virtual interviews, we used screen share technology 
                            in Discord or Zoom allowing the team to see what the user is doing when they are interacting with the 
                            Lo-Fi Prototype. For in person testing, laptops were used to test the Lo-Fi prototype making it easier 
                            to observe the user’s interactions.</p>

                        <h6>Hi-Fi Prototype Creation</h6>

                        <p>
                            In order to develop a hi-fi prototype from our lo-fi prototype, our main task was to make our application
                             clickable.  This involved building frames in Figma which could link to one another, 
                             so that it gives the experience of being interactive.  Conceptually, most of our tasks and 
                             features of the app stayed the same.  For example, having a recommendation page, searching, and browsing. 
                              The majority of the hi-fi development involved working out the specific implementations of our features, 
                              and solidifying some of the nuts and bolts of these features.  
                              One example is the extensive settings page we developed, which incorporates suggested settings that our 
                              users were interested in, such as changing languages.  
                              Another design decision was to separate a business’s information from its comments, to keep those 
                              two pieces of data separate.  In our final hi-fi, there is a comments button on the business page which 
                              takes you to its forum.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once we had a working, interactive prototype, we worked with recruited users to gain additional 
                            feedback on what could be improved.  These users complete tasks that we selected in order for us to 
                            gauge the difficulty and intuitiveness of these tasks. 
                            Probably the biggest piece of feedback was to add a back button into our application. 
                            We found that users got frustrated when they had to start at the main root window and go through the
                            same pages again, not being able to simply go backwards. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Testing our prototype with users was extremely helpful, and is generally a good idea for design teams. 
                            The reason it is important is that these users are the ones who are going to be using the application, and the 
                            only way to accurately tell if they will be able to figure everything out is to observe them trying to do so. 
                            Working within an application for a long time can make it hard for the designers to see themselves as someone new 
                            looking at the app for the first time, so it’s imperative to get that outside feedback.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Finally, we also used TA feedback on our prototype to finalize some of our design decisions for the
                             final, submitted prototype.
