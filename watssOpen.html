                        <h6>How does our application create joy?</h6>

                        <p>Covid-19 has led to the closing of many entertainment locations including theaters, 
                            escape rooms, mini-golfing, and more. In some places, these entertainment locations open up 
                            with COVID-19 precautions and guidelines only to close back down several weeks later. Due to this, 
                            it becomes difficult to keep track of which places are open and which aren’t. Furthermore, the lack 
                            of revenue for these entertainment places means that they may have shut down temporarily or permanently. 
                            With people having to stay at home and keeping their distance from others, the toll on everyone’s mental
                             health is increasing. Entertainment is one way to bring joy to one’s life and the pandemic has either
                              prevented this from happening or has greatly impeded it. Therefore, our application can bring joy to our
                               users because it lets users know which entertainment locations are open during the Pandemic. 
                               It also makes searching for business information less stressful, and a lot more effective. 
                               Our research with users showed us that keeping up with business information can be stressful, and
                                our application is aimed to reduce this stress.

                        </p>

                        <h6>Our Application has more value than Google</h6>

                        <p>
                            This application has more value than Google Maps because all the information will be housed 
                            in one place. In Google there are a lot of missing information and it forces the user to call 
                            specific businesses to get more information. Our application stops that because we are able have all
                            the data housed in one source. This allows the users to get all the information they need without 
                            having to forage for all of their information. Furthermore, our push notification setting allows users
                             to get directly notified when the businesses they follow update their policies. 
                             This means that user-tailored COVID updates are sent directly to the users phone. 
                             Lastly, the forum section allows users to read other costumers comments on the business, 
                             which could be helpful if the business hasn’t posted the specific information needed.
